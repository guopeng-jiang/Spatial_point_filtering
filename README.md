# A simple program for filtering spatial point data

This is a part of my PhD research to develop methods to process sensor-derived data for crop management in New Zealand.

This simple program removes common errors in the historical yield monitor data recorded from combine harvesters. 

Data required:

  (1) Yield monitor data collected over the years.
  (2) Field boundary in which the data is collected. 

Data format: shapefiles

Before running:

  (1) Historical yield monitor data put in one folder 
  (2) Field boundary data put in the other folder 
  (3) Start a new folder for the output data 

Potential error: 
  Different names for the yield attribute caused by different yield monitors ... 
  Here it should be called "Yld_Mass_D", not anything else.
  Simply change the name into "Yld_Mass_D" will bypass the error.
